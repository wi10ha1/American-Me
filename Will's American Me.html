  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <h1 align=center style="color:#C21818;">Introduction Essay</h1>
  <hr>
  <p style="color:#5F1B56;" >&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Hello I am William John O’Halloran, this essay is an introduction to who I am. There are many ways to define a person like things they like,
  dislike, fears, and hobbies. Humans are all basically the same genome sequence so the only way to set each other apart is by defining who we are.
  I was born on December 7th, 2000 to Paul and Sue O’Halloran. I had a normal childhood like most other kids, I went to daycare until I could go to school. During the
  summers I went to the cabin with my family and hung out with friends whenever I could. When I was twelve I had an accident with my knee where I blew out my ACL and
  tore my meniscus, I had to have surgery and my recovery time was about 2 months. I had a really hard time with this because I was unable to leave couch yet alone leave
  house and that bothered me. I recovered fine and then everything went back to normal pretty quick.<br><br>
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I live a very routine life, work in the summer, then school and during school I am in golf and hockey. Hockey is by far my most favorite sport/activity that I have ever
  been apart of because it definitely has an effect on my life outside of the arena. Hockey is definitely a big part of who I am.<br><br>
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I “graduated” from 8th grade at St. Mary’s in Bird Island and then I moved schools to BOLD High School in Olivia for my freshman year. I was pretty nervous for the change
  but I actually ended up liking BOLD a lot more than I thought I would. I coasted through freshman and sophomore year and through that time I learned a lot about myself
  and others like how to talk to people and how to treat people and I think that was because I finally realized that deep down everyone is not so different. I think that
  after I realized something like that, it made interaction with others so much more enjoyable for me and that is probably why I can always be seen talking to another
  person. During freshman year I found a deep love for music and in a very odd way, music has also helped me become who I am today. The type of music I would listen to
  would change my mood and I was able to use that in productive ways ever since I found that out.<br><br>
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp During sophomore year I was chose to be one of the three captains on the hockey team and that was a really big deal for me because it is hockey and that alone meant a
  lot to me but it was also a huge reward for what I have been working for in that sport. I would say that I am a leader rather than a follower and I think that is one
  of the main reasons I was able to get elected. I find it a lot easier to be the leader I am in hockey than it is in school, but that doesn’t stop me from not trying
  in school. I enjoy going to school because I like to interact with others and I take pride in my education because it is going to be affecting my future.<br><br>
  &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp If I had to choose a few words to describe myself I would choose spunky because any of my friends would tell you that I’m pretty weird, and my other word would be
  determined because I don’t like to leave things unfinished because that would be selling yourself short!

  <h1 align=center style="color:#C21818;">Family Story</h1>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp In 1862, Thomas Halloran and some of his brothers were arrested for the murder of Gustave Thiebault. Thomas’s
      brothers were permitted to leave custody, but Thomas had to stay and take the murder charge on his own. Whether
      innocent or guilty, Thomas knew that the odds were better for eviction than acquittal, and if convicted it
      would be death by hanging. <Br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Daily Express reported that Thomas received the “not guilty” verdict and
        the crowd cheered; however, no one knew if the cheers were for the belief of Tom’s innocence or by distaste
        for the victim. Thomas never discussed the case with any of his family and no one was ever charged with the
        crime, so the question of innocence with Thomas Halloran is still unknown.</p>

  <h3>Future Plans</h3>
  <h1 align=center style="color:#2D8A90;">Future Plans</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2 align=center style="color:#C21818;">College Plan</h2>
	  <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp My school for choice for college is the University of
      Minnesota-Duluth. I chose UMD because the college has the right engineering classes I am looking
      for and their engineering programs there are known to be good. Duluth, the
      town itself, is a paradise for me becuase the city isn't too big but there
      is still a big city feel to it, the history in the area is fascinating,
      and everything there is beautiful. I've gone on a few visits to UMD and
      so far there hasn't been one thing that I've disliked about that place.
      The location of all the class's are in very convenient places. I thoroughly
      enjoyed being there.</p>

	<h2 align=center style="color:#C21818;">Degree & Courses Needed</h2>
	  <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Civil engineers work on construction, renovation, and rebuilding projects.
      They often work alongside architects, technologists, and other industry
      professionals. Engineers may alternate time between working in an office
      and visiting sites. A bachelor's degree is what I will need for a Civil
      Engineer, and I will also need these to earn professional engineer licensure
      in the Civil Engineering field.</p>

    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp To pay for college I plan to constantly have a job at college
      so I can have a consistent income during school, and then during the
      summers I will work back at home in Olivia because I can find jobs that will get
      me a decent amount of money. I will be applying for as many scholarships
      that I can because it’s just more money to help me. I also plan to take a
      student loan out to help pay for the majority of the expenses.

	<h2 align=center style="color:#C21818;">Career Info</h2>
	  <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp My dream job is to be a Civil Engineer. I like the job
      because the majority of it deals with math and I enjoy doing math. The
      job consists of work on construction, renovation, and rebuilding projects.
      Engineers will often work winters at their desk planning projects for the
      summer, and then during the summer they work at their sites. The median
      annual salary for a civil engineer is $82,220, and there is a 8% projected
      job growth.</p>
